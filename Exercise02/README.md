## 1. Class Shape :
- abstract class
- 2 fields (base, this)
- 2 virtual properties for overriding
- 1 abstract method

## 2. Class Rectangle inherited from Shape
- normal class
- has 2 constructors : 
 + one is to initialize fields in base class Shape
 + one is to set initial values for height and width by accessing fields in Shape and call constructor with 'this' (~base)
- override Area method with its own formula

## 3. Class Square inherited from Rectangle
- normal class
- has 2 constructors : 
 + one is to initialize fields in base class Rectangle
 + one is to set initial values for height and width by accessing fields in Rectangle and call constructor with 'base'(~this)
- override 2 properties of Shape by setting their values

## 4. Class Circle inherited from Square
- normal class
- has 2 constructors : 
 + one is to initialize fields in base class Square
 + one is to set initial values for radius by accessing fields in Square and call constructor with 'base'(~this) radius = 1/2 circumfence
- 1 property Radius relating to height
- override Area method with its own formula
