# Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational Gang of Four (GoF) design pattern,  defined in their seminal book [ Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://amzn.to/2N22a2H), in which they presented a catalogue of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems.

The pattern is useful for encapsulating and abstracting the creation of objects. It is distinct from the more common [Factory Pattern](https://garywoodfine.com/factory-method-design-pattern/) because the Builder Pattern contains methods of customising the creation of an object.

Whenever an object can be configured in multiple ways across multiple dimensions, the Builder Pattern can simplify the creation of objects and clarify the intent.
