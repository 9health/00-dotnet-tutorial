# Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational Gang of Four (GoF) design pattern,  defined in their seminal book [ Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://amzn.to/2N22a2H), in which they presented a catalogue of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems.

The pattern is useful for encapsulating and abstracting the creation of objects. It is distinct from the more common [Factory Pattern](https://garywoodfine.com/factory-method-design-pattern/) because the Builder Pattern contains methods of customising the creation of an object.
