## Adapter pattern


The Adapter Design Pattern is the first software design pattern of the Structural Pattern, that the Gang of Four (GOF) Design Patterns,  presented in their book , [Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://amzn.to/2PdkTck)
that I will discuss in series of Structural Design Patterns.

The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows incompatible interfaces, from disparate systems to exchange data and work together.  It is extremely useful when integrating tool-kits, libraries and other utilities together.
