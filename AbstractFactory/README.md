# Abstract Factory Pattern

The abstract factory pattern is one level of abstraction higher than [Factory Pattern](https://garywoodfine.com/factory-method-design-pattern/). 

The Abstract Factory Pattern is used when you want to return several related classes of objects, each of which can return several different objects on request. Typically you may use the Abstract Factory Pattern, in-conjunction with other factory patterns like [Simple Factory Pattern](https://garywoodfine.com/simple-factory-pattern/)
