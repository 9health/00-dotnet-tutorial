# Software Design Patterns in C# and .net core


In software development a Software Design Pattern is a reusable solution to commonly recurring problems. A software design pattern is a description or template used to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

 In 1994, the so called Gang Of Four (GOF) published their book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://amzn.to/2Nx1Iq6) in which they presented a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. 

 The book captured 23 Patterns that enabled software architects to create flexible, elegant and ultimately reusable design patterns without having to rediscover or reinvent the design solutions for themselves.

 Through a series of blog posts on [garywoodfine.com](https://garywoodfine.com) I will discuss these patterns and more on how C# .net core developers can implement these patterns in cross platform .net core software solutions.
